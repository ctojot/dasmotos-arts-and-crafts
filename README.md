## Off-Platform Project: Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

In this project, youâ€™ll build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on your own computer. This project will provide you with less guidance than previous projects. You should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

## At a high-level, this project will require the following

- A folder structure that makes sense for the project
- An HTML file
- A CSS file

## Notes

I included the solution that Codecademy provided as well so I can compare the major differences.

- Right off the bat, when firt recreating the HTML code from the mock up, I thought that I needed to start giving each and every single element a class tag. Just so that I would be able to make specific tweaks to the styling of each and every element. I don't think I did too bad, but I see that I might have went overboard with all the class tags. I was trynig to seperate the different sections when I could've just seperated them with a few div elements.

- Now looking at the 2 CSS's files. My goal was to use the least amount of code as possible by combining elements together that required similar styling. Now, regardless of my file being a few lines longer, I believe it's only cause of the naming convention I chose for classes.

- Another big thing that I am noticing with the solution code is that, on the index.html file, they also chose to label the different sections as well with some comments. I want to try to implement this into how I code. It would help guide people through the different parts of my code and cause I now how it feels to look as someone else's code and feel lost. It truly helps.
